# Oxifed an AI Coding experiment side project

With the feedback from my followers I decided to put this file here manually. This is a Experiment. A very out there couple of hours on the side running AI and seeing how it goes Experiment.

If others want to join and run AI against it aswell I would be happy to make this a multiplayer experiment.

AI is still getting sidetracked and doing weird things. But I enjoy this kind of strategic thinking process in the evening more than having to code so I am happy to push it around
until it does the thing that I want reasonably well.

Manuall work is also welcome. I want to have a fun multiplayer side quest experience here with people. But I am also happy to run this as a small Singleplayer thing. And just build up it's support
and corporate structure with the knowledge that I have about Processes, Company building and so on.
